# Pixel 2 VoLTE VoWiFi in unsupported countries
## Introduction
This module enables VoLTE & VoWiFi in unsupported carriers worldwide :)

Check MBNs in the folder: `/system/vendor/mbn/mcfg/configs/mcfg_sw` in this repo, if you want to see if your country is available within this module.

If not, send private message on XDA to [me](https://forum.xda-developers.com/m/vortuks.5945472/)

## Usage - How to use
1. Download latest version from [Release page](https://github.com/stanislawrogasik/Pixel2XL-VoLTE-VoWiFi/releases/tag/Latest)
2. Flash in Magisk

## Troubleshooting
Try one or more of the following methods:
- Toggle VoLTE/VoWiFi/Airplane mode

# Credits
- Big thanks to [IonutGherman](https://forum.xda-developers.com/m/ionutgherman.6250062/) from XDA for providing intial MBNs from crDroid.

# QPST/EFS Method
There's a old method with loading MBNs directly to the MODEM NV in folder `QPST EFS Method`
You can use it if this module doesn't work and you have proper MBN.
