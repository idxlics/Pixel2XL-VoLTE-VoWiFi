# Introduction
This is a guide, how to enable VoLTE and VoWiFi on Pixel 2 XL using EfsTools and Magisk without changing SELINUX to permissive.

Environment:
- Pixel 2 XL
- ArrowOS 12 (Android 12) - GAPPS edition (should work on lower Android versions - but can't guarantee)
- Magisk 24.1
- Windows 11(unfortunelly, can't get EfsTools to work on Linux)
- Working ADB(Platform tools from Google)

# How to do it?

## Pre-requirements

It's recommended to do a **backup** of whole system. At least do a backup(or download a proper image from Google) for **modem**, in case something go wrong.

We'll be editing this partition :)

## 0.) Get files

## 1.) Install my own module in Magisk(as of now I'm using Magisk 24.1)

## 2.) Reboot

## 3.) Use ADB & EfsTools (also QPST to verify if there's a proper connection)

## 4.) Uninstall Magisk module

## 5.) Reboot & verify
